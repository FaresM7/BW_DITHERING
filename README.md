# BW_DITHERING
The app converts colored images to black and white. Initially, the user selects the image they wish to edit. The image is then converted to grayscale based on the user's preference for red, green, or blue tones, assigning the chosen color's value to every pixel. Following this, dithering is applied to achieve a complete black and white effect. The user can choose between threshold and random modes for this process. In threshold mode, pixels are turned white if their value is above the user's specified threshold, otherwise black. In random mode, a random value is assigned to each pixel, which then determines its color as per the threshold logic. The final image is displayed with an option for the user to save it. If the photo appears incomplete, adjusting the GUI display is recommended.
